He brings a very unique ability to truly see a project in a 3-dimensional manner. This gives him the foresight to plan for best practices in implementing the client’s wishes and can provide realistic options for achieving the desired finish. Before coming to ULFBUILT, Magnus was a master trim carpenter, with an eye for detail. He also has a background in electrical. These skills coupled with his understanding of a client’s vision and 3D translation of drawings gives him a superior understanding of a project. &nbsp;Magnus is dedicated to executing the finest of details and highest quality of work. In addition to speaking Swedish and English, Magnus is currently developing his fluency in Spanish.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMagnus has lived in the Vail Valley for 16 years and currently resides in Edwards. Originally from Sweden, the snow-capped peaks of our mountains brought Magnus to the valley. Mountain biking, enduro and dirt biking, hiking, camping, and snowmobiling have anchored his heart and passions to the Vail Valley. &nbsp;When he’s not hiking, biking or skiing you can find Magnus on an adventure wherever the road takes him.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E","2023-02-16T15:06:29.579Z","2023-02-16T15:07:55.681Z","2023-02-16T15:07:55.678Z","magnus-nilsson","Senior Superintendent",null,{"data":14},{"id":15,"attributes":16},16,{"name":17,"alternativeText":12,"caption":12,"width":18,"height":18,"formats":19,"hash":46,"ext":23,"mime":24,"size":47,"url":48,"previewUrl":12,"provider":49,"provider_metadata":12,"createdAt":50,"updatedAt":50},"Magnus-Nilsson-1.jpeg",1024,{"thumbnail":20,"medium":28,"small":34,"large":40},{"name":21,"hash":22,"ext":23,"mime":24,"path":12,"width":25,"height":25,"size":26,"url":27},"thumbnail_Magnus-Nilsson-1.jpeg","thumbnail_Magnus_Nilsson_1_c48c72304d",".jpeg","image\u002Fjpeg",156,4.87,"\u002Fuploads\u002Fthumbnail_Magnus_Nilsson_1_c48c72304d.jpeg",{"name":29,"hash":30,"ext":23,"mime":24,"path":12,"width":31,"height":31,"size":32,"url":33},"medium_Magnus-Nilsson-1.jpeg","medium_Magnus_Nilsson_1_c48c72304d",750,63.85,"\u002Fuploads\u002Fmedium_Magnus_Nilsson_1_c48c72304d.jpeg",{"name":35,"hash":36,"ext":23,"mime":24,"path":12,"width":37,"height":37,"size":38,"url":39},"small_Magnus-Nilsson-1.jpeg","small_Magnus_Nilsson_1_c48c72304d",500,32.08,"\u002Fuploads\u002Fsmall_Magnus_Nilsson_1_c48c72304d.jpeg",{"name":41,"hash":42,"ext":23,"mime":24,"path":12,"width":43,"height":43,"size":44,"url":45},"large_Magnus-Nilsson-1.jpeg","large_Magnus_Nilsson_1_c48c72304d",1000,103.54,"\u002Fuploads\u002Flarge_Magnus_Nilsson_1_c48c72304d.jpeg","Magnus_Nilsson_1_c48c72304d",101.74,"\u002Fuploads\u002FMagnus_Nilsson_1_c48c72304d.jpeg","local","2023-02-16T15:05:59.751Z",{"pagination":52},{"page":53,"pageSize":54,"pageCount":53,"total":53},1,25],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
